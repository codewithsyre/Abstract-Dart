# Abstract-Dart
# Abstract Class

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be initialized.
It is used to define the behavior of a class that can be inherited by other classes. 
An abstract class is declared using the keyword abstract.

# Abstract Method
An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. 
It is declared with a semicolon (;) instead of a method body.

# Why We Need Abstract Class

Subclasses of an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods of the abstract class. 
It is used to achieve abstraction in the Dart programming language.

# Constructor In Abstract Class

You can’t create an object of an abstract class. 
However, you can define a constructor in an abstract class. 
The constructor of an abstract class is called when an object of a subclass is created.

# Key Points To Remember

You can’t create an object of an abstract class.
It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
It is used to define the behavior of a class that other classes can inherit.
Abstract method only has a signature and no implementation.
